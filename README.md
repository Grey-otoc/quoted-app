# Quoted

## Description
An iOS application that allows users to effortlessly save, organise, and share quotes from books. The app provides a visually engaging, card-based interface to manage books, quotes, and book collections. Users can manually enter quotes or extract them via image scanning using text recognition, with support for marking favorites, adding page numbers, and annotating thoughts on the quote. Quoted emphasizes smooth user flow, responsive SwiftUI views, and modular components for easy extension.
